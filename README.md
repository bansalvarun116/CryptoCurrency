# CryptoCurrency
 
I welcome you to this project. Here we implement a Blockchain based cryptocurrency. 
If you are new to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchains (and if you are not familier with concepts like UTXOs, Mempools etc ) then I will suggest you to go through the basic_crypto.py first and then go through a_bit_sophticated_crypto.py

Pls install Postman 
it is easier to run and test the flask framework there 
and install all the required libraries which have been imported in the code


Happy Exploring !!!
